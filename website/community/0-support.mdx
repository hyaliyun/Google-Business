My business doesn’t have a storefront. Can I still have a Business Profile?
Yes, you can have a profile if your business doesn’t have a physical address as long as you make in-person contact with customers. You can also have a profile if you’re a hybrid business that serves customers at your business address and visits or delivers directly to customers. You may also have a profile if you’re a service-area business that visits or delivers to customers directly, but doesn’t serve customers at its business address, like a plumber or cleaning service.

Do I need to download an app to create and manage my profile?
You can use the Google Maps app to manage your Business Profile on your mobile device. On your desktop, you can manage directly from Google Search in the browser.
