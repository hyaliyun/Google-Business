Why do I need to verify my business?
Verification allows us to confirm that you are the rightful owner of the business, so that you have permission to manage your Business Profile. Your security is important to us and we don’t want anyone else but you or your approved managers making updates to your profile.

I have a physical storefront but I also offer online services. How do I show this on my profile?
You can show that you offer both in-person and online services on your Business Profile using attributes.
