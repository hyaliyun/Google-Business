# CF-Worker-Dir

CF-Worker-Dir is a cloud function program for the Cloudflare Worker platform. You can use it to build your own navigation page in one minute. CF-Worker-Dir provides a wealth of custom configurations, and it also reserves an interface to help you sell your domain name. If you don't have a website on your domain name, you might as well use CF-Worker-Dir to stop wasting your domain name. ðŸ˜‰

## Program installation
### Quick installation
1. Create a new **Worker** on the [Cloudflare Worker](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) management page.
2. Paste the code in `index.js` on the left side of the Worker editing page.
3. Modify the configuration content of `config` according to your own needs
### Advanced installation
> How to bind your own domain name
1. Complete the quick installation according to the above, and return to the domain name management panel
2. Click `Workers` to enter the Workers management page
3. Click `Add route` to set a new route
4. `Route` can enter the subdomain you want to use. If you use it on the root domain name, just enter the current domain name. `Worker` selects the Worker that was quickly installed above
> The domain name address used by `Route` must have resolved the A record**. If there is no IP address that can be bound, you can enter 8.8.8.8 as a placeholder:)
