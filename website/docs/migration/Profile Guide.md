## Profile Guide


A Google Business Profile (GBP), also known as Google My Business (GMB), is a free service that enables businesses to manage their presence on Google, and most importantly allows your business to show up in Google Map searches. You can improve your local SEO efforts by optimizing your Google business listing to make it more competitive.

If you aren’t familiar with these profiles, perform a google search for a local competitor’s brand name—the panel of business information (phone, hours, reviews, etc.) on the right side of your screen is a Google Business Profile. For many small local businesses, their Google listing is just as important, if not more so, than their website for their success.

Profile setup is fairly straightforward, but in our experience, businesses with an older listing usually need to make updates for improved performance and reporting. Staying on top of GMB optimization is one of the key things you can do for your [local SEO strategy](https://www.collaborada.com/blog/local-seo-small-business-tips)—an effective profile can help drive more clicks, calls, and customers.

Here we look at GMB setup, on-going optimization, and best practices for SMBs.

## Getting Started with Google My Business

When working with small businesses that are focused on local SEO, we start by reviewing and optimizing their Google business page. These listings are available to both brick-and-mortar businesses and [service area businesses](https://support.google.com/business/answer/9157481) (SAB). Individual providers who are part of a larger practice—such as doctors, dentists, lawyers, or real estate agents—can also create a profile, as well as departments within universities, hospitals, or government institutions.

* **First step.** After [building a business website](https://www.collaborada.com/blog/build-a-business-website-that-brings-you-clients), we recommend first verifying the site with Google Search Console as this can lead to faster or instant verification of your Google Business Profile.
* **Know the rules.** Before claiming your Google business listing, you should first read and understand Google’s [guidelines for representing your business](https://support.google.com/business/answer/3038177?hl=en). A couple of common issues:
  * Your business name should reflect your business’s concise, real-world name. It should not include a tagline, keywords, or legal terms (e.g. LLC).
  * If you plan to list a co-working address, you must have your own signage and staff onsite during posted business hours.
* **Create your profile.** Ensure you are signed into the Google account associated with your business, then [set up and verify your profile](https://support.google.com/business/answer/10514137). Include your accurate business name, category, address if applicable (make sure it matches your website), phone number, website URL, and hours. If you are a service area business, you do not have to enter an address.
* **Enable any relevant features.** You can choose whether to receive calls or chat requests, display services, etc. Note, it is fine to not utilize these features.
* **Add photos and videos.** Use high-quality visuals to give customers a good overview of your business and offerings. If applicable, include interior and exterior pictures, products, or menu items. If nothing else, upload your logo or brand mark.
* **Wait for verification.** In some cases, depending on the [verification options](https://support.google.com/business/answer/7107242) you are presented, the GBP verification process can take up to a week or two. If you are only offered video verification, pause and closely [review the rules](https://support.google.com/business/answer/14271705?hl=en) before filming.

## GMB Optimization

To maximize how often your business page is seen in local search results (which some people might refer to as “GBP SEO” or “GMB SEO”), Google says your business should present “accurate, complete, and engaging” information. Your business profile enhances visibility in “near me” type searches, so it is important your information is thorough.

***Note:**** Do not use the words “near me” on your website for SEO purposes—this common misconception about local search optimization is on our list of *[*SEO myths*](https://www.collaborada.com/blog/h0gw4sh)*.*

More specifically, Google’s [documentation](https://support.google.com/business/answer/7091) says their local search algorithm prioritizes  **relevance** ,  **distance** , and  **prominence** . In terms of relevance, you need a complete and detailed profile. For distance, Google uses what they know about a searcher’s current location along with what they know about your business.

Prominence is the tricky piece of the puzzle. It refers to how well known a business is offline and online. Many factors can influence online prominence including having locally relevant links, article mentions, directory listings, and Google reviews.

Google clearly states that your ranking in organic results is a factor for prominence, so make sure your SMB follows [SEO best practices](https://www.collaborada.com/blog/small-business-seo). Note, we wholeheartedly encourage [DIY SEO for small businesses](https://www.collaborada.com/blog/diy-seo), and our [customers](https://www.collaborada.com/testimonials) will tell you that a tailored [SEO training](https://www.collaborada.com/seo-training) is the best way to get started.

To update your GMB profile, ensure you are signed into the Google account associated with your listing, [sign in](https://www.google.com/business/) and click “edit profile” to make updates.

* **Description.** Ensure you have a concise, relevant business description that describes what makes your business unique. In a natural writing style, include the [keywords](https://www.collaborada.com/blog/find-keywords-to-bring-traffic-to-website) that your potential customers would likely search.
* **Categories.** If it has been a while since you first setup your GMB listing, check your category(s). Google used to limit the number of business categories you could choose, but has since expanded the number. Google recommends using as few categories as possible to describe your overall core business, but we find being thorough with categories is helpful. That said, you only want to choose categories that are truly representative of what you do—don’t overreach.
* **Get reviews.** Encourage customer reviews. Positive reviews will help you stand out in local pack or local finder results. As an example, search for a service in your area and look at the local results, would you be more likely to click on a listing with starred reviews or a listing with no reviews?
  On your GBP marketing dashboard, click the toggle to expand the dashboard fully, look for the “Ask for Reviews” tab. Here you’ll find a shortened review link that you can send to customers. Note, reviews should be authentic and come in at a natural pace. Respond professionally to customer reviews, even negative ones, to demonstrate you value feedback and transparency.
* **Update your hours.** Watch for emails from Google asking if you are open on certain holidays—it takes less than one minute to click the link and toggle open/closed for any upcoming holidays. Holiday hours is one of the easiest ways to interact with your profile on a regular basis.
* **Update photos.** If it’s been a while you might want to update your photos. To remove old photos, click the photo that displays in the profile on the right, in the next window toggle to “by owner,” here you can use the trash can to remove old images. To add a logo, click “add photo” on your profile dashboard.
* **Other sections and features.** Regularly review all sections of your GMB profile to keep things up-to-date, especially events, specials, menus, or pricing. You’ll notice Google occasionally adds new features—for example, they recently added the option to connect social accounts. Again, it is fine to not use all the features presented—use common sense to determine what applies to your business and your operations.

## Business Profile Best Practices

* **Own your profile.** Your business (versus an agency) should be in control of your Google Business Profile. The profile is a digital asset of *your* business. When you go to sell the business, the buyer will expect to receive ownership of any associated digital properties: the website, business listings, social media, etc.
  Note, it is common for [shady marketers](https://www.collaborada.com/blog/seo-scams) to create GMB profiles and retain ownership—this makes business owners feel beholden to continue using their services. Your business should create the profile, then [add users](https://support.google.com/business/answer/3403100?hl=en&ref_topic=4539640&sjid=12477006645108046440-NC) as needed. If you need help with setup, many marketers will assist via Zoom.
* **Review regularly.** Set recurring calendar reminders to periodically review your Google business page. You will be surprised at both how often Google makes changes and how often your information becomes out-of-date.
* **Clean up any duplicates.** Many SMBs inadvertently have multiple profiles. Learn about [merging accounts](https://support.google.com/business/answer/12755979?hl=en).
* **Monitor performance.** Your GMB dashboard includes a [Performance tab](https://support.google.com/business/answer/9918094) where you can review profile interactions such as how many people viewed your profile and clicked through to your website, how many people requested directions, or the number of calls placed through the profile.

The key is keeping your GMB listing complete, accurate, and full of engaging content. This makes you stand out on Google Search and Maps, earning more clicks and customers.
