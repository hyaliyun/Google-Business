## Formerly Google


Google Business Profile, previously known as Google My Business, is a tool to help you get listed on Google and manage how your business shows up across products like Google Maps and Search.

A Google Business Profile is crucial for local businesses to appear on the search engine with the correct information for location, opening hours, or phone number.

## Should you have a Google Business Profile?

Businesses looking to attract new customers used to rely on local word-of-mouth and traditional marketing strategies. While flashy storefronts and old-school mailers may have once enticed customers to purchase products and services, modern customers have now shifted their attention to your business’s digital presence and online reputation.

When your customers want to find local proprietors to do business with, they turn to search engines first—and nearly [90 percent of all search engine ](https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share)traffic goes through Google. Every day, Google’s “spiders” are crawling the web looking for the most relevant businesses to display at the top of their results page. Since the [first three listings of a Google search get 60 percent of the clicks](https://backlinko.com/google-ctr-stats), earning a top spot on the first page of Google’s search results almost guarantees a swarm of new business. As the main starting point for millions of customers around the world, it’s more important than ever that business owners play ball with the all-powerful search engine.

But how does a business ensure Google positions its listing in this most profitable real estate? One of the leading factors is a handy tool called Google Business Profile. When someone in your area searches for a local service, such as “pizza in Modesto, CA,” Google quickly weighs all of the information it knows about those search terms—and  *voila* ! A perfectly curated list of businesses meeting those requirements appears on the customer’s screen.

Customers can quickly check out photos, see business hours, view each parlor’s star ratings, read reviews, and ultimately decide if that’s where they’ll order their Friday evening pizza. Google Business Profiles are a powerful way to increase your search engine visibility and reach new customers looking for businesses just like yours.

A well-optimized Google Business Profile also boosts the reputation of your business by leveraging the power of online reviews. Almost as important as a cozy slot in Google’s top three search results are the quantity and quality of customer reviews. Since [84 percent of people trust online reviews](https://www.inc.com/craig-bloem/84-percent-of-people-trust-online-reviews-as-much-.html) just as much as the word of a friend, a listing packed with 5-star ratings and glowing feedback is one of the cornerstones of a solid search engine strategy.

The takeaway? An optimized web presence on popular platforms like Google Business Profile is the digital equivalent of a well-dressed storefront, encouraging customers to come in and learn more about your products. Similarly, a business without a search engine strategy is the equivalent of a dark, seemingly boarded up shop—deterring business and warding off new customers.

This guide outlines everything you need to know about Google Business Profile—and how you can harness its unparalleled strength to generate more website traffic, bolster your reputation, and kick off a new day of explosive growth in your business.

## How to Claim Your Google Business Profile (If it Already Exists)

The first step towards transforming how local customers find your business starts with claiming your business listing. Google already has a deep trove of listed businesses, so it is likely that there is already one available for yours. Here’s how you can take full control of your listing.

1. 1. Start by searching your business on Google.
   2. Google will display what it knows so far about your business. You might see your address, phone number, and a brief description of your services. Underneath this main information, select “Own this business?”
   3. You receive a prompt to sign in to your Gmail account. If you do not have one, no problem. You’ll have the opportunity to create one.
   4. Once you’re logged in, select “Manage Now.”
   5. There are a handful of helpful ways to confirm that you are indeed a verified representative of this business. Google will send you a verification code in one of three ways: by phone, by email, or by postcard.
2. **By Phone**

* Some businesses will have the opportunity to verify via **phone number.** Google will contact that phone number with an automated message—so make sure you’re readily available to answer it.
* Enter the five-digit verification code and click “Submit.”

1. **By Email**

* Other businesses may have the option to verify via  **email** .
* Google will send you a five-digit verification code to the email address on file. Input the code sent to your inbox and select “Submit.”

1. **By Postcard**
2. * * The default verification method relies on snail mail. Google will send a postcard to your business address.
     * Keep in mind that the postcard can take up to five days to receive. Once you’ve received it in your mailbox, log back into your Google Business Profile account.
     * Type in the code printed on your postcard. Click “Submit.”
     * Do not fret if your postcard fails to arrive. In your Google Business Profile account, you can request a new one.

## How to access Google Business Profile

Accessing your Google Business Profile is easy. To do it, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Google account.
2. Go to google.com/business and click ‘My Business’ on the left-hand side of the page.
3. Under the ‘Manage Locations’ tab, you will be able to select an existing business profile or create a new one for your business.
4. Find your profile, click on it, then click ‘Edit’ if you’d like to update any information that may have changed.

## How to Create a New Google Business Profile

If your business does not have a listing in the Google ecosystem, you can easily create one at [google.com/business](http://google.com/business).

1. 1. Start by logging into the Google account associated with your business, or create a new account.
   2. Select “Start now.”
   3. Here is where you’ll input the basics behind your business. Google will ask a few easy questions, like your business name and location. There are a few location settings to consider.
      1. If your location is not a physical storefront (like a locksmith or masseuse), or you operate strictly on a delivery-only basis, click “I deliver goods and services to my customers.”
      2. Do you operate your business out of your home and prefer not to list your address? No problem—select “Hide my address (it’s not a store)” to prevent Google from displaying your full address on public-facing pages.
   4. The next step prompts you to** Select a Service Area. **For example, restaurants that also home deliver food, or a local cleaning team will want to use this section to inform potential customers if they’re within your delivery or service area.
      1. Service areas can be as small or large as you would like. You are able to add cities, counties, states, provinces, or even entire countries where your services are available.
      2. Make sure your service area is as precise as possible, as this is how Google will determine your search relevancy. For example, if you mainly provide accounting services for local businesses in Rancho Cucamonga, CA, use the city as your specific service area. That way, you’re more likely to appear in searches for “Accountants in Rancho Cucamonga, CA” than if you used the entire state of California as your service area.

* Next, you’ll need to **choose a business category.** You want your business category to be as clearly defined as your service area. The vaguer the business category, the less likely you will appear for the searches most relevant to your business. From “diesel engine repair service” to “miniature golf course,” Google provides hundreds of potential business categories, so you can easily find one that best pinpoints your service offering.

## Google Business profile section

### **Overview Header**

The overview header provides a quick snapshot of your business, highlighting the details most important for potential customers. This information should be clear, concise, and most importantly—accurate. Here are the necessary components of your overview header.

### **Photo**

One of the easiest ways to stand out amongst other Google searches is by using bright and vibrant images in your Google Business Profile. In a sea of words and hyperlinks, images draw our eyes and attract our attention. They bridge trust with customers by giving them a tangible glance into your business. In fact, [businesses that use imagery in their listings receive 35 percent more clicks](https://support.google.com/business/answer/6335804?hl=en&__hstc=20629287.eb05463bc4f4a31134f5e3f63aa3dd00.1592570369682.1592570369682.1592570369682.1&__hssc=20629287.1.1592570369682&__hsfp=2820522066#Share_photos) to their website than those that do not. Show the inside of your business so customers know what to expect. Extend a digital handshake with smiling, welcoming photos of your staff. Whether you’re a restaurant or a dental practice, using captivating imagery is a sure-fire way to stand out from the crowd.

### **Name**

Although “business name” seems like a no-brainer, there are actually a few details to consider. Make sure you write your business name identically on your Google Business Profile as you do throughout other important places on the internet, like your website. If your business is called “Main Street Plumbing,” do not abbreviate to “MS Plumbing” in your Google Business Profile. Use the precise name your business goes by without any unnecessary abbreviations or add ons. Just one minor change can significantly reduce your search engine visibility. In local SEO, this is referred to as [NAP](https://neilpatel.com/blog/how-to-attract-more-local-customers-a-complete-guide-to-local-seo?pid=00004874_0063t00000v9opc) (Name, Address, Phone Number) which can significantly impact local search when it’s not done correctly

### **Logo**

Your knowledge panel also includes your business logo. Just as you should use your accurate, unabbreviated business name in your listing, you also want to use the logo customers expect to see—this is not the place to play around with new colors or fonts. A recognizable logo is an easy way to connect with customers who may have previously seen your branding on your storefront or fleet vehicles throughout your local service area.

### **Buttons**

Google offers a variety of call-to-action buttons that instruct customers on how to interact with your business. These buttons encourage customers to **visit your website** or query driving, walking, or public transportation **directions** to your business.

Mobile viewers may have a couple of additional options. **Call** or **message** buttons allow them to instantly contact your business at the tap of a button.

Browsers will also see a “ **Save** ” button where they can add your business to personalized lists like “Favorites” or flag it as a place they “Want to go.”

### **Description**

Your Google Business Profile also features another powerful tool: a business description. In 750 characters or less, you have the opportunity to illustrate how you stand out from the competition. Use this area to captivate browsers with the story behind your business. What types of products or services do you offer? What makes your business special? Keep your description clear and straightforward. Avoid stuffing your description with sales pitches or promotional content that might run off customers. Whether you have a beautiful outdoor dining patio, provide locksmith services within 45 minutes, or bake pizzas over a wood fire, this is where you can use your words to truly connect with customers and describe the experience of doing business with you. And don’t forget to add relevant SEO keywords!

### **Reviews**

While referrals from a friend used to lead the way in driving new business, customers now turn to online reviews and trust their word just the same. They’re also one of the leading factors affecting your overall search ranking. This section gives a quick snapshot of your reviews, providing an overall **star rating** and  **review count** . Here, customers are looking for highly-rated listings, so five shining stars backed by a trove of positive feedback is an easy way to win their business.

### **Attributes**

Attributes—or “details” on mobile devices—allow you to add special badges that highlight unique features of your business. Ranging from amenities like “Wheelchair accessible elevator,” to “Rooftop Seating,” and “Trivia Night,” there are a variety of attractive attributes to select from. There are also a few unique ones that help tell the story of your business.

* **Veteran-Led/Owned by Veterans:** Is your business led by a member of the armed services? This is a special indication to celebrate their service to our country.
* **Women-Led/Owned by Women: **Another special tag that distinguishes businesses owned or led by women.
* **Recently Opened:** New in town? The “Recently Opened” attribute informs customers you’ve cut the ribbon, encouraging them to try out a new local hotspot.

While you can select these Attributes from your Google Business Profile dashboard, Google also pulls in other relevant data to populate this section. Google encourages customers to answer bite-sized questions about your business, and this section is where Google displays their responses. Attributes like “Is this place good for kids?” or “Is there a dress code?” are generated from user Q+A and displayed in this part of your listing.

### **Service Options**

Here’s where you can highlight any special services offered by your company. Do you offer **delivery, curbside pickup,** or  **no-contact delivery** ? Use the Service Options section to highlight these offerings.

### **About Header**

The About Header lists important information like address, phone number, hours, and some additional attributes.

* **Address: **Just as it is important to spell your business name consistently across the web, you want to give your address the same detailed treatment. For example, if your website lists your address as “123 Main Street,” you should do the same on your Google Business Profile. Avoid abbreviations like “St.,” or “Blvd.” if they’re not what you use on other locations across the web. Most importantly, you want your address listed accurately. If you recently moved locations or units, ensure your Google Business Profile is always up to date.
* **Phone Number: **Similar to your physical address, you want to make sure your phone number is accurate and up-to-date. Incorrect contact information is one of the fastest ways to lose a potential sale.
* **Hours: **This is one of the most important sections of your profile. Customers search for local businesses because they’re interested in doing business with you  *now* . So much so, that [88 percent of browsers searching for local businesses visit or call the location within one day](https://www.socialmediatoday.com/content/importance-local-businesses-being-found-mobile-devices-infographic). The last thing you want to do is send a motivated customer to a locked door. Is a holiday coming up that will impact your business hours? You should regularly update this section with the most accurate information.
* **Additional Attributes: **Some business types also have access to category-specific features. Restaurants can use this area to link to a menu or highlight third-party delivery services that offer their eats. This is also where hotels can display class ratings, booking platforms, and guest amenities.

### **Updates Header**

The Updates Header is a powerful section where you can highlight the goings-on of your business. A well-curated Updates Header proves to browsers that you’re a lively, bustling business ready to take on new customers.

* **Products: **You can showcase popular product or service offerings on Google Business Profile. Try displaying a photo, a brief description, and a price for your “most purchased” items that customers are likely searching for.
* **Questions & Answers: **This section gives browsers a forum to ask other users about their experience with your business. People can ask questions like, “is there readily available street parking?” and previous customers can leave a reply. Keep in mind that anyone is able to answer these public questions. By monitoring your Google Business Profile account, you can quickly hop in and answer any incoming questions before inaccurate information creeps into your listing.
* **Reviews: **This section is where Google highlights your business’s customer reviews. They’re typically one or two lines showcasing keywords that pertain to your business. For example, this section might show a review mentioning “portion size” for a restaurant or “appointment availability” for a local dentist.
* **Posts: **Posts are brief updates you can share to your listing. You can highlight an upcoming event, a short article discussing a new service offering, or a recently won award. You can publish photos, videos, and text paired with a special call-to-action button. Posts are a great way to show the personality behind your business.
* **Offers: **Share a time-sensitive promotion with customers using Offers. If you’re offering a free cleaning or a 20 percent discount on small business tax services, this is the place to share. Offers are only available for a certain period of time.
* **Events: **Have a special event coming up? Use the Events section to garner excitement and attract attendees. Events must have a date and start and end time. You can include photos, videos, text, and a call-to-action button to drive involvement.

### Frequently Asked Questions

Frequently asked questions (FAQs) are an important part of your Google Business Profile. You can add up to 10 FAQs that customers can view in order to get answers to common questions. Once you have added at least one FAQ, a Questions & Answers tab will appear on your profile page where people can ask and answer questions about your business/services. You can respond to customer’s questions directly or provide helpful resources or suggestions as a response. This feature helps your customers get the information they need quickly when they look your business up online.

## Google Business Profile Dashboard (What You See)

Your Google Business Profile dashboard is your main control center. It allows you to control how Google displays your business information across the web. It’s important to familiarize yourself with the ins-and-outs of the dashboard so you can always keep your listing up-to-date and packed with interesting content that drives new business.

### Home

This is the central hub of everything related to your Google Business Profile. It’s how you can keep your information updated, publish exciting posts to your listing, view analytics, or manage the administrative inner workings of your account.

### Posts

Imagery, video, and text posts are the best way to directly communicate exciting news and timely promotions with local customers. A well-curated Posts section shows browsers that you’re an active, bustling business, and you can select from a variety of post types like basic updates, events, or offers. By sharing an inside look into your business, posts are a great way to boost credibility and trust.

On the Home screen of your Google Business Profile, tap “Post +.” You can then select the type of post you’re interested in creating. You have up to 1,500 characters to tell your story, but Google suggests [sticking to a 150-300 character range.](https://support.google.com/business/answer/7390603) Images must have a minimum resolution of 400px wide by 300px tall, while the maximum upload size for a video is 100 MB. Pair your post update with a call-to-action button like “Buy,” “Learn more,” “Book Now,” or “Visit.” Posts will remain readily accessible in your Knowledge Panel for 7 days.

#### **What’s New**

Updates are like micro blog posts attached to your Google Business Profile. Have a new product or service to announce? Did your team recently receive a local award or recognition? Have just a few slots left for an upcoming training session? Here’s where you can showcase your latest news.

#### **Offers**

Offers are posts featuring an exclusive, time-sensitive promotion, discount, or sale. Offers must have a start and end date, so this is not the ideal post type for an open-ended deal.

#### **Events**

Events require a start and end date, as well as a timeframe. If you do not select a timeframe, it will display as an all-day event.

### Information: Add/Edit Customer-Facing Information for your Business Profile

Looking to update information about your business? In the Info tab, you’re able to edit key information like your address, business hours of operation, phone number, website address, business description, and more. There are also a few helpful tools in the Info and Settings tabs to make sure you’re getting the most out of your Google Business Profile experience.

#### **Labels**

Labels are an easy internal way to organize multiple locations into groups. You can give each location a unique identifier that can group locations regionally or by any other tag deemed necessary by your company. That way, you can quickly monitor the activity of certain segments of your business.

#### **Email addresses**

While it’s important to ensure every section of your Info page is up-to-date, bear in mind that Google integrates your contributions with user-submitted content. Photos and reviews from customers will appear in your listing—and you want to know about it right away. In the Settings tab, you can double-check that your email addresses and notification settings are up-to-date so you can receive immediate updates on your page activity.

### Insights

The Insights panel in your Google Business Profile dashboard provides you with detailed background information as to how customers are finding your business. Not only do Insights offer a look into how customers find your listing, but they provide a bounty of analytics on how your customers are interacting with your listing.

* **Find out how customers find your business listing: **Your dashboard shows a chart illustrating precisely how browsers came across your business. There are a few key analytics listed here.
* **Direct searches:** Customers who searched for your business by its specific name or address.
* **Discovery searches: **This number shows how many customers found you by searching for a related business category, product, or service that you offer.
* **Branded searches: **A summary of how many customers stumbled across your business by searching your brand or a brand related to your business.
* **What search terms do people use? **You can even see what search terms people are using to find your business. Are they searching “Italian dinner” or “pizza”? This section will define what search terms are most popular amongst those who visited your listing.
* **What did people do once they visited your listing? **This is perhaps one of the most useful reports available in your Analytics cache. It summarizes what customers did after they found your listing. Did they visit your website? Did they tap “Call” from a mobile device? Did they request driving or public transportation directions? Getting found on Google is one thing, but generating foot traffic or online orders is what really drives your business.

### Reviews

This section of your dashboard lists the reviews customers have left for your business. While reading through your positive reviews can be a great confidence boost, it’s also important to read thoroughly—and respond to!–the negative ones. A negative review can be bad for business, but an *unanswered* negative review is even worse for your online reputation.

Open the listing you would like to manage and click “Reviews.” Click “Reply” to begin crafting your response. Thank those who have left positive testimonials and follow up on those who left negative feedback. Be friendly and approachable without taking it personally. Negative reviews are a great opportunity to explore issues in your business and quickly rectify them before they snowball out of control. Apologize for the poor experience and, if necessary, welcome them back for another visit with a discount or special offer.

Google takes the word of user-generated reviews very seriously, so they will rarely remove a review simply because of a negative spin. However, you have the opportunity to flag a review for removal if you feel it is fake or inaccurate. It’s possible that a competitor may hire fake reviewers to tarnish the reputation of your business. If you suspect this is happening, make sure to alert Google to it immediately.

### Messaging

While foot traffic and phone calls may have been the main forces driving new business in the past, text messaging has emerged to the forefront as a powerful customer communication tool. After all, people are using their phones to search for your business aboard loud train commutes or during work hours. Finding a quiet moment to call a business is sometimes an inconvenience. Customers are flocking to businesses that offer text-based messaging as a mode of communication.

Luckily, Google Business Profile offers powerful messaging tools so your business can capitalize on this trend. You can permit customers to text questions, which you receive through the Google Business Profile app. Manage these options, review incoming questions, and reply through the Messages tab of the Google Business Profile app. Promote trust with timely replies—nothing kills customer interest more than an unanswered customer service question. Plus, it’s important to reply to messages within 24 hours, or Google may deactivate the feature from your account.

### Add Photos or Other Multimedia to your listings

Use the Photos section to create a vibrant ecosystem of imagery within your Google Business Profile. Publish welcoming photos of your staff, delicious snaps of mouth-watering menu options, interior shots of your location, and different approach angles so customers know what to expect if they’re driving or walking for a visit. For every photo you share, you’ll be able to check out its total number of views so you know what type performs best for your audience.

Bear in mind that your Knowledge Panel may populate with user-generated photos, so you want to use the Photo tab to monitor any newly posted images. Although you cannot remove these photos, you can flag a photo for review if you feel it is inaccurate or inappropriate.

Since images in your posts section are square, a 1:1 ratio is best. Ideally, Google suggests you use JPG or PNG files that are 720 px tall by 720 px wide. Click the Photos tab to add them to your listing.

#### **Cover Photo**

Your cover photo is a photo that showcases the best of your business. Bear in mind adding a cover photo does not guarantee top placement, and may sometimes rotate out for images deemed more popular. To add one, click Photos in the left-hand menu. In the Overview section, you can select a logo photo or a cover photo. The recommended size for a cover photo is 1080 px wide by 608 px tall.

#### **Icon/Logo**

Your icon or logo serves as your avatar. When you publish new posts or respond to customer reviews, this image will populate beside your remarks. Similar to other photos within your listing, these display as square images, so Google recommends images you use images that are 720 px wide by 720 px tall.

#### **Videos**

Your listing can also include other multimedia like videos. It’s estimated that one minute of video is [equivalent to 1.8 million words of text](https://searchengineland.com/rise-video-8-tips-boost-sites-seo-227498), so videos are a quick way to highlight the fun and exciting aspects of your business. Google Business Profile videos can be up to 30 seconds long and 100 MB in size. Using short “sizzle reel,” videos are a great way to show your business in action to potential customers. Show customers a behind-the-scenes peek at how you do business, introduce them to your team, or use videos as a portfolio to showcase renovation projects or cake making. Easily upload videos via the Photos tab, and select the type of multimedia you’d like to add.

### Bookings

For certain businesses, Google provides the opportunity to manage bookings from your Google Business Profile dashboard. Google integrates with many popular reservation platforms, making it easy to tie in your current system with your Google Business Profile. You can manage your integrations in the Bookings tab.

### Services

In the Info tab, there is a powerful feature for service-based businesses, appropriately called Services. Perfect for businesses like lawyers, music instructors, or pest control specialists, this tool allows you to add a brief summary of your offerings. You can create a category of services, like “Guitar Lessons” and add various products or tiers like “30-Minute Instructional Session” and “1-Hour Instructional Session.” Paired with each service, you can provide pricing and a 1,000 character description.

### Website Builder

Flashy websites require a significant investment of time and money, often discouraging many small business owners from getting started. To empower small businesses with the tools needed to evolve their digital presence, Google Business Profile includes a free tool for designing mobile-optimized websites in minutes. To get started, click the Website tab from the menu on the left side of your Google Business Profile dashboard. You can select from pre-designed templates and color palettes and easily add in captivating text and photos. In just a few clicks, you can create a vibrant, user-friendly site for your business.

### Users

In the User tab, you can invite fellow employees to become administrators of your listing. There are three types of administrative roles available: Owner, Manager, and Site Manager. An Owner has full run-of-the-house, including the ability to remove business profiles and manage the capabilities of other users. At the opposite end of the spectrum, Site Manager is a smaller role primarily for publishing posts and editing main information. Before assigning new roles, familiarize yourself with each of their [corresponding functionalities](https://support.google.com/business/answer/3403100?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en&oco=0).

### More Tools in Google Business Profile dashboard

There are even more tools available in the Google Business Profile dashboard, packed with many features to supercharge your search engine visibility strategy. The tools below make it easy to work alongside agencies who might manage some components of your digital ad plan.

#### **Locations**

Locations are easy ways for agencies or organizations that manage multiple listings to view all of the accounts and listings they manage. For instance, you can create a location group of all Midwest store locations to share with a regional manager, but you do not want them to have access to stores in the Southeast. By clicking on the Manage Locations tab, you can create easily manageable groups and share permissions with the right people.

#### **Ads**

Strategically bidding on popular keywords queried by your customer base is another mighty tool for increasing your search engine visibility. By clicking “Create an Ad,” you can launch ad campaigns in moments. Simply link your Google Ads account with your new Google Business Profile and you’ll be off to the races.

#### **Linked Accounts**

Working with a digital marketing team to create ad campaigns? Those looking to run ads on behalf of your business can submit a request to link up with your accounts. You’ll find these requests in the Linked Accounts tab, where you can approve or decline access for advertisers.

## Google Business Profile Benefits for Small Businesses

### Marketing Benefits

While local businesses often feel like larger companies have a leg up when it comes to promotional opportunities, the opposite is true for Google Business Profile. Google Business Profile *prioritizes* local businesses and ranks their services and locations well above big-box merchandisers. With this in mind, it’s important for small businesses to leverage the full power of Google Business Profile offerings to maximize search engine visibility, enhance the customer experience, and improve overall sales.

### Ranking Factors for Local SEO

There are three factors that heavily impact search engine visibility for local businesses: relevance, distance, and prominence.

Relevance indicates how closely your business offering relates to a customer’s actual search query. For instance, if your business offers manicures and pedicures, the term “nail salon” is highly relevant as opposed to the more generic “salon” or “spa.” Clarity far outweighs the benefits of trying to cast a wide net.

Proximity is also a leading driver behind success with local SEO. As discussed, it’s important to pinpoint your service area as sharply as possible. Customers looking for “Audi repair shop Hoboken, NJ” want to find just that—a business based in, or very close to, Hoboken, NJ. Repair shops in farther reaches of the state will have significant challenge ranking for this location, but those that highlight their nearby offerings will appear closer to the top of the list.

Prominence is the third-largest factor influencing local SEO. This measures how important or interesting your business appears to be. How do search engines determine interest level? A listing that is a bustling hub of fresh posts, recent promotions, and upcoming events signal importance to search engines. Similarly, a wealth of beaming 5-star reviews tells Google that it’s a flourishing business that provides a stellar experience to local guests.

### Free Website

Is your business behind the 8-ball when it comes to establishing a strong web presence? Many small business owners view website design and launch as a daunting, expensive process. But, your website is one of the most powerful ways to connect with potential customers. To arm small business owners with the tools they need to build a strong web presence, Google Business Profile offers complimentary website design tools. You can easily create a well-designed, mobile-ready website for free.

### Review Links

Studies show that the average customer [reads 10 reviews](https://www.brightlocal.com/research/local-consumer-review-survey/) before deciding they can trust a business. Not only does a trove of high-quality testimonials bring more customers to your site or store, but it’s an important factor when it comes to determining search engine rank. It’s important to take a proactive approach when it comes to collecting positive feedback from satisfied customers.

Google Business Profile makes the process painless by offering a quick one-click link you can distribute to your customer base. In your dashboard, click “Get more reviews.” Google will generate a link that you can copy and paste. Here are just a few strategies you can use to promote your reviews link on your Google Business Profile.

#### **Email Your Review Link in a Thank You Email**

Do you send thank you emails after each visit or purchase? Update your automated email script with your Google Business Profile review link. In just a couple of clicks, customers can submit shining 5-star testimonials that will steadily improve your search ranking.

#### **Share on Social Media**

Once a month, share a reminder for your fans and followers to rave about their latest experience with you. Whether you prefer Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook, encourage customers to share positive feedback and photos from their most recent visit.

#### **Use a Platform Like **[**Podium**](https://www.podium.com/reviews/)

Requesting reviews one-by-one can be a drain on your current resources. By partnering with a platform like Podium, you can automate the process by sending out immediate post-purchase review requests. Even better, Podium offers a variety of drag-and-drop templates and pre-written wording so you can rack up reviews effortlessly.

### Communication Benefits

Google Business Profile also provides a host of exciting ways to connect with customers. While businesses used to rely on incoming phone calls and walk-ins to schedule appointments or answer customer service questions, these methods are dwindling in popularity. Customers are no longer willing to wait days for a reply—they demand  *convenience* . Google Business Profile offers two free tools to enable your business to push to the forefront of this important trend.

#### Messaging

One of the least used apps on smartphones is, believe it or not, the actual phone app. In one surprising study, less than [50 percent of smartphone users reported using their phone to make a call over the previous seven days](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-phone-call-isnt-dead-its-evolving-11571457605). While outbound calls rapidly decrease in number, text messaging is on a wild rise. In fact, people are sending 7700% more text messages than they were ten years ago.

So why are companies still reliant on technologies customers no longer use? Google Business Profile makes it easier than ever for you to kick outdated technology to the curb. Using the Messaging capability within the Google Business Profile app, you can easily add a “Message” button to your mobile listing. This allows customers to communicate with you via text message in just one click. Instead of sending customers to cumbersome Contact Us pages or on a search through customer service phone numbers, they can reach out to your business right in the window they found it in.

#### Booking Services and Appointments

Customers are also unwilling to wait for days or weeks to schedule appointments. They want to see what time blocks are available and easily make a booking without adding extra steps to their to-do list. Using the Bookings tool, you can link your preferred scheduling provider with your Google Business Profile to accept on-demand appointments with ease.

#### Respond to reviews

[Responding to reviews](https://www.podium.com/article/responding-to-reviews/) is a great way to boost your credibility and show customers that you care about the service they receive. You should respond to positive, neutral, and negative reviews. Be sure to address the customer by name, thank them for their feedback, and then respond in an appropriate manner depending on the content of their review.

### Management Benefits

Juggling the needs of multiple locations puts significant strain on a small business team. One of the top management benefits of Google Business Profile is a large suite of tools for managing multiple locations. Using robust batching tools, you can create listings for different neighborhoods and make sweeping, cross-location updates with the click of a button.
