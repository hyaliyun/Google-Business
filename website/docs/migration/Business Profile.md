## Business Profile


An online presence is important for merchants, and a majority of online customers use a search engine to find businesses and make purchases from them. Customers who search locally in Google Search or Maps find Business Profile listings right where they search, one click away from the merchant's listing.

Business Profile provides a fast and easy way for businesses, products, brands, artists, and organizations to manage their online presence with Google.

When a small business owner shows potential customers what makes their business special, they're more likely to attract new customers on Google. Business owners can easily establish and complete their Google listing by sharing photos, business hours, a link to their website, and real-time updates.

Listings are also where customers learn about a business, leave reviews, and share pictures of their experience with products or services.

## Business Profile APIs

The [Business Profile APIs](https://developers.google.com/my-business/ref_overview) are programming interfaces that allow developers to write applications to manage their Business Profile account and location data.

The APIs allow merchants or their representatives to manage how their data is presented across Google and control who co-manages their data. User-created data, such as photos, posts, and reviews, can be managed through the APIs.

To retrieve local business information and provide location awareness to end users, see the [Google Maps Platform documentation](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/details).

If you're a developer who wants to write applications that manage your Business Profile data, or you're a developer who uses the AdWords API to manage manual location extensions, we recommend that you sign up for the Business Profile APIs.
