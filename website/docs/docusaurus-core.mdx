Overview
First, you will want to visit https://www.google.com/business/

Select "Sign In" to create an account. Once you've created your account, you'll be able to manage your Google Business Profile listing right from the Google search results. To get started, you'll need to provide some basic information about your business, such as your address or service area(s), website URL, phone number, hours of operation, and more. This will help potential customers find you online and get in touch with your business.

TIP:

Avoid keyword-stuffing your business name as this can potentially be cause for suspension of your profile as it violates Google's Business Profile guidelines. You can always include these terms in your tagline or slogan separate from your business name.

Step 2: Select your business type
When selecting your business type, you'll want to choose the option that accurately represents your business. Google offers a few different options to choose from, including Local store, Service business, and Online retail. If you have a physical storefront, you should select Local store. If you're a mobile business that travels to your client's location, you should choose Service business.

After completing the first step of setting up your Google Business Profile, there's still work to be done. With your profile now active, you have the power to manage and update it as needed. You'll be directed to the search results screen where you can make changes or edits to your profile. It's important to monitor your profile regularly and make updates when necessary. However, make sure not to update all information at once, as this could potentially lead to a suspended profile. Instead, make small changes here and there, as needed. By regularly monitoring and updating your profile, you can ensure that customers have accurate information about your business and increase your online visibility.

Verification is an essential step in making your Google Business Profile visible to the public. This enables potential customers to engage with your business by messaging you, leaving reviews to share their experiences, and discovering your business online. Don't forget to verify your business if you haven't already to ensure that your profile is up and running!

TIP:

Once you have set up your Google Business Profile, you can easily manage it by searching for "my business" on Google Search.
