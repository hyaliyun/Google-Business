### Troubleshooting Google Business Profile setup issues

If you're experiencing issues with setting up your Google Business Profile or importing your profile, try the steps below:

Step 1 | Make sure that your domain is properly connected

If you get an error when you try to add, create, or import a profile, you may have an issue with your domain. Make sure that your domain is properly connected and then try again.

Learn more about [connecting a domain purchased from Wix](https://support.wix.com/en/article/connecting-a-domain-purchased-from-wix) or [connecting a domain purchased elsewhere](https://support.wix.com/en/article/connecting-a-domain-purchased-elsewhere).

Step 2 | Check for browser issues

Issues with your browser may sometimes cause problems when you try to add, create, or import a profile.

Try clearing your browser's [cache](https://support.wix.com/en/article/clearing-your-browsers-cache) and [cookies](https://support.wix.com/en/article/clearing-wix-cookies-from-your-browser) and also make sure that [3rd party cookies are not blocked](https://support.wix.com/en/article/enabling-cookies-in-your-browser). If this doesn't work, you can also try using a different browser.

Step 3 | Check the location that you added to your profile

The location for your business that you add to your profile should be in the same country as your actual location.

For example, if you enter a UK service area address, Google will check to see if your geolocation is also in the UK. If Google detects that locations don't match, you may have issues importing your profile.

Make sure to check that the location you add to your profile is in the same country that you are in.

Step 4 | Disable your VPN

The location for your business that you add to your profile should be in the same country as your actual location.

For example, if you enter a UK service area address, Google will check to see if your geolocation is also in the UK. If Google detects that locations don't match, you may have issues importing your profile.

Virtual private networks (VPNs) let you hide your [IP address](https://www.wix.com/encyclopedia/definition/ip-internet-protocol-address) and can make your computer appear to be in a different country. Using a VPN may cause issues when you try to import your profile. Try disabling your VPN and importing your profile again to see if it resolves the issue.

Step 5 | Make sure that your business is verified

If you're trying to import an existing profile, it must be verified before you can import it.

If you're not sure, sign in to your Google Business Profile account and check the verification status.
