# The Ultimate


As a local business owner, or a marketer working with local clients, you’ll likely already understand the importance of Google Business Profile (formerly known as Google My Business).

This essential local marketing tool launched in 2014 and has since been embraced by businesses all around the world. If you operate a business that serves a local area, such as a gym, a restaurant, or a plumbing service, then you’ll want to include Google Business Profile (GBP) in your regular marketing activities.

Without GBP, you’ll be unable to rank in the Local Pack and the Local Finder—which should be a high-priority goal for any local business. Since the Local Pack appears at the very top of the search results for a local query, you definitely won’t want to risk missing out on this huge potential slice of web traffic. Before you jump into a [Google Business Profile Audit](https://www.brightlocal.com/local-seo-tools/auditing/google-business-profile-audit/), though, you'll need to learn the basics.
