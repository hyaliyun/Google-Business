# Create & Verify


Your free Google business listing (known as your Business Profile) can do more than you think. When properly optimized, it showcases your best features and makes it easy for consumers to discover, learn about, and contact your business. But in order to properly optimize your Business Profile, you need access to it, and in order to access it, you need to verify with Google that you are the rightful owner.

While it seems as though it should be as simple as ‚Äústep one create, step two claim, and step three verify,‚Äù the process is neither that simple nor that linear‚Äîwhich, if you‚Äôre reading this post, you have already figured out. That‚Äôs because it requires three different Google accounts and two different Google platforms, all of which have very similar names. Talk about a brain bender.

![how to create and verify your google my business account account vs listing](https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how20to20create20and20verify20your20google20my20business20account20account20vs20listing.png)

So, in this post, I‚Äôm going to first iron out for you exactly what‚Äôs what in Google, and then give you a clear-cut roadmap to creating a Google My Business account and using it to claim and verify your Business Profile on Google.

## Why create a Google My Business account?

Whether you‚Äôre a local mainstay or are just [starting a business](https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/12/06/small-business-ideas), your Google Business Profile makes it easy for consumers to discover, learn about, and contact your business online.These are the core benefits of a [Google My Business account](https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/08/what-is-google-my-business), and if that‚Äôs not enough to convince you, consider the disadvantages of **not** having one.

**You risk losing customers.** Without a Google My Business account, you don‚Äôt have control over the information displayed in your Business Profile, and according to a [BrightLocal study](https://www.brightlocal.com/research/local-citations-trust-report/), 68% of consumers would stop using a local business after finding incorrect information online.

 **You risk a poor reputation** . Without a Google My Business account, you cannot respond to your Google reviews, which is a [mandatory section of your Business Profile](https://www.sterlingsky.ca/turn-off-google-my-business-reviews/). And with reviews being both a Google ranking factor and the [number one influence](https://www.meetsoci.com/blog/key-insights-from-soci-summit/) on consumer buying, being able to manage them is a must.

 **You lose out to competitors** . An empty or bare-bones Business Profile is akin to having an unkept storefront. If you don‚Äôt take care of your business, how can consumers trust that you‚Äôll take care of them? They‚Äôll be much more likely to click on and engage with a Business Profile in the search results that has lots of attractive information and looks lively.

**You lose SERP real estate.** Google ranks Business Profiles according to their quality, and a Business Profile alone is not enough. A Google Business Profile managed through a Google Business account, however, can be [optimized to rank above competitors ](https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/03/google-my-business-optimization)for relevant keyword searches.

*Which listing would you choose? The unclaimed one on the left or the one optimized by Google My Business account on the right?*

## What you need in order to claim and verify your business on Google

By now, it should be clear that creating a Google My Business account and verifying ownership of your business is crucial if you want to provide accurate information, respond to reviews, attract customers, and [rank higher in local search](https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/10/wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/11/02/local-business-marketing-tips)‚Äîeven on the[ first page.](https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/19/get-on-first-page-google)

As mentioned earlier, however, the process is not super simple. It involves two different Google platforms and three different Google accounts, all of which have similar names, and some of which you likely already have. So to get you off on clear footing, let‚Äôs first iron out the terminology.

**Google Account: **This is the free account you create with Google so you can have access to Google Docs, Google Drive, Google Photos, Gmail, and more. Many call it their ‚ÄúGmail account,‚Äù but Gmail is just one of the features; you can actually use any email to set up a Google Account. In this post, I‚Äôll use the term ‚Äústandard Google Account‚Äú to refer to this account type, just to avoid confusion. Most business owners already have two standard Google accounts‚Äîone they use for their personal life and one they use for their business.

![how to create and verify your google my business account what is google account](https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how20to20create20and20verify20your20google20my20business20account20what20is20google20account.png)

**Business Profile:** This is your [free business listing](https://localiq.com/products/listings/) on Google that appears on Google Maps, the local results of Google Search, and the right-hand Knowledge Panel of Google Search.

**Google My Business account:** This is the free account you create that gives you a dashboard to manage and enhance your Business Profile.

![how to create and verify google my business account google my business dashboard](https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how20to20create20and20verify20google20my20business20account20google20my20business20dashboard_0-2.png)

## How to verify your business on Google

Now that you have the proper terminology laid out, let‚Äôs put the pieces together to form a full picture of the process.

The **goal** is to gain full access to your *Business Profile* on Google.

The **means** by which you do this is your  *Google My Business account* , which you sign up for using a *standard Google Account.*

The **steps** to complete the process are as follows:

1. Make sure you have a standard Google Account for your business.
2. Make sure you have a Business Profile.
3. Create a Google My Business account.
4. Request to claim your Business Profile.
5. Verify ownership of your business.

Now, with the groundwork laid out, you are armed and ready to successfully claim and verify your business on Google. The steps outlined below are written linearly, and in some cases, you‚Äôll need to skip down a step. But I‚Äôd still encourage you to read them all carefully to avoid hitting roadblocks or creating duplicate accounts.

### Step #1: Make sure you have a Google Account for your business

This is the standard Google Account we described in the terminology section above.  **If you already have one (make sure it‚Äôs not your personal-use Google Account), skip down to Step #2** . If you don‚Äôt have a Google Account for your business, follow the steps below.

1. Go to [accounts.google.com/signin](https://accounts.google.com/signin).
2. Click ‚ÄúCreate account.‚Äù

![how to create and verify your google my business account create google account](https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how20to20create20and20verify20your20google20my20business20account20create20google20account_1.png)

3. You‚Äôll see a drop-down with two options. Choose ‚ÄúTo manage my business.‚Äù

![how to create and verify google my business account manage a business](https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how20to20create20and20verify20google20my20business20account20manage20a20business_0.png)

4, Supply the necessary information.

### Step #2: Make sure you have a Business Profile

Your Business Profile is the official term for your Google business listing. As mentioned above, Google Business Profiles are separate from Google My Business accounts. A Business Profile can exist on its own, without Google My Business account. The problem with this is that the business owner has no control over the information in that Business Profile until they claim it, and this is done through Google My Business. Bottom line: You‚Äôll want to make sure you have a Business Profile to claim once you‚Äôve set up your Google My Business account.

**If you know you‚Äôve already created a Business Profile, skip down to Step #4.** If you haven‚Äôt created one or are unsure, follow the steps below.

Note: Even if you didn‚Äôt create it, **there‚Äôs a good chance your Business Profile already exists. **This is because a Business Profile is simply a place on Google Maps, which any person or computer can add. So to check and see if you need to create a Business Profile, follow these steps:

1. Go to [Google.com/maps](https://www.google.com/maps).
2. Search your business name.
3. If your business name populates in the drop-down **with an address next to it,** this means your Business Profile already exists. Great! You can move on to Step #4.

![how to create and verify google my business account check maps for google business profile](https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how20to20create20and20verify20google20my20business20account20check20maps20for20google20business20profile_0.png)

If your business name **does not **populate with an address, select it and you‚Äôll see something like this:

![how to create and verify google my business account add missing place the token shop](https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how20to20create20and20verify20google20my20business20account20add20missing20place20the20token20shop_1-2.png)

4. Select ‚ÄúAdd a missing place,‚Äù and you‚Äôll see a screen like this:

![how to create and verify google my business account add missing place form](https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how20to20create20and20verify20google20my20business20account20add20missing20place20form.png)

5. Provide the requested information. Notice that you‚Äôll have the option to claim the business within that same window. Since you don‚Äôt have a Google My Business account yet, you‚Äôll need to move on to Step #3. If you already have a Google My Business account, you can follow the prompts and you‚Äôll end up at Step #5‚Äîlook at you go!

### Step #3: Sign up for a Google My Business account

The means by which you claim your Business Profile on Google is through a Google My Business account. Provided you have a standard Google account (see Step #1), here‚Äôs how to sign up for a Google My Business account.

1. Make sure you are logged into the standard Google Account for your business (and not the standard Google Account for your personal life).
2. Go to [google.com/business](https://www.google.com/business/).
3. Select ‚ÄúManage now.‚Äù

![how to create and verify a google my business account google.com/business](https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how20to20create20and20verify20a20google20my20business20account20google.com3Abusiness.png)

4. Provide the basic information Google asks for, including.

* Business name [(creative business name ideas here!)](https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/08/business-name-ideas)
* Address
* Website
* Phone number
* Delivery area (if applicable)
* Category

Once you connect this account with your Business Profile (the final step of this post), additional fields will open up in your dashboard so you can provide even more information about your business. This information is the key to optimizing your business for [local SEO](https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/05/08/seo-during-covid-19) and attracting more customers through your free listing.

### Step #4: Request to claim your Business Profile

This is where we start putting the pieces together. Unfortunately, creating a Google My Business account (from Step #3) does not automatically connect it to your Business Profile (from Step #2). You need to tell Google to connect them, and you do this by verifying ownership of your business. To do this, start by locating your [Business Profile on Google Maps ](https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/02/how-to-rank-higher-on-google-maps)or Google Search and requesting to claim it. You can do this one of two ways:

#### **Claim request method #1:**

1. Go to google.com and search for your business name and location. If your Business Profile appears on the right-hand side, find the ‚ÄúOwn this business?‚Äù option and select it.

![how to create and verify your google my business account own this business arnos cleaners](https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how20to20create20and20verify20your20google20my20business20account20own20this20business20arnos20cleaners.png)

2. From there you‚Äôll be taken to a screen that says ‚ÄúManage this business so you can reply to reviews,[ update info](https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/09/edit-update-google-business-listing), and more.‚Äù

![how to create and verify your google my business account own this business arnos cleaners manage this business](https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how20to20create20and20verify20your20google20my20business20account20own20this20business20arnos20cleaners20manage20this20business.png)

3. Click ‚ÄúManage now,‚Äù and follow the prompts to claim your business. Once again, make sure you‚Äôre logged in with the standard Google Account used for your business, and not for your personal life, referred to in Step #1.

#### **Claim request method #2: Google Maps**

1. Go to [Google.com/maps](https://google.com/maps).
2. Type in your business name.
3. Click on your Business Profile, which will expand.
4. You‚Äôll then see an option to ‚ÄúClaim this business.‚Äù

![how to create and verify your google my business account own this business arnos cleaners claim through maps](https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how20to20create20and20verify20your20google20my20business20account20own20this20business20arnos20cleaners20claim20through20maps-2.png)

Clicking on ‚ÄúClaim this business‚Äù will then overlay the same screen you saw in the first method, but this time right over the map.

![how to create and verify your google my business account manage this business google maps](https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how20to20create20and20verify20your20google20my20business20account20manage20this20business20google20maps.png)

4. Click ‚ÄúManage now‚Äù and follow the prompts. Again, make sure you‚Äôre logged in with the Google Account you created for your business referred to in Step #1.

### Step #6: Verify ownership of your business

This is the home stretch! If you need to grab a Gatorade or some orange slices, I‚Äôll be right here when you get back.

When you click on ‚ÄúManage now‚Äù as instructed in Step #5, you‚Äôll be asked to provide information to prove you are the rightful owner of the business. Depending on the type of business you have, if you created the Business Profile and you‚Äôre logged into your Google My Business account, you might get validated on the spot. If you aren‚Äôt the one who created the Business Profile, Google will send you a verification code that you‚Äôll enter into your Google Business dashboard. Depending on the circumstances of your account/security requirements of your industry, you may be given your verification code via regular mail, email, or text.

![how to create and verify your google my business account verification pin code](https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how20to20create20and20verify20your20google20my20business20account20verification20pin20code.png)

Once you receive the code and enter it into the box, you will have full ownership of your Business Profile on Google! You can now manage reviews, update information, add more attractive details, and optimize it for [successful local marketing](https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/07/24/local-marketing-tips).
