# managing products

Listing products on a GBP can increase an SMB's relevancy and visibility in local searches, provide free advertising for the business, and allow users to better understand the types of products or services they offer. ([Google](https://support.google.com/business/answer/9124203?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en))

Let's imagine for a moment that you’re managing the online presence of a local bakery. Seeking a way to boost sales, you add your client's range of baked goods to her Google Business Profile. Over time, when locals searched for bakery treats, their offerings began to appear more prominently. Customers mentioned how they found them through Google, and soon foot traffic to their bakery increased.

The product listings you created for their most popular desserts got customers excited to try their famous double-fudge brownies, enhancing their in-store experience when they finally could try the real thing. For your client, showcasing her products on Google didn't just attract new customers—it turned them into repeat buyers.

Here are some more benefits of choosing GBP for promoting products:

### Free advertising

[Local listings](https://www.vendasta.com/local-listings/listing-builder/) on Google are essentially free advertising, and it allows your client to share useful information about their business to showcase what makes them unique.

Plus, a well-maintained GBP listing can pull in up to 35% more clicks to their website. ([Localiq](https://localiq.com/blog/google-my-business-benefits/))

## Can any business use the product feature?

If your clients run a brick-and-mortar retail business, they can absolutely use the Product Editor in GBP, so long as the products comply with [Google’s Shopping Ads policy](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/6149970?sjid=9688425465176364588-NA&visit_id=638278810113010869-3830206166&rd=1).

However, some businesses wouldn’t be eligible for using the Product Editor, such as ones that feature specific types of products or services that are deemed [prohibited](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/6150006?sjid=9688425465176364588-NA) by the platform.

## What kinds of products can and can’t be added?

Products submitted to a Google Business Profile listing must adhere to the platform’s Shopping Ads Policy.

### Key policies to comply with

Here are some of the key policies that businesses and agencies need to comply with to successfully add a product:

#### Listing prohibited content

Businesses can’t list items that would be considered counterfeit goods, dangerous products, or other content deemed inappropriate by Google’s standards.

#### Conducting prohibited practices

This refers to network abuses, including what Google perceives as malicious content or sites that offer little unique value. Additionally, this broad policy is applied to products or accounts Google has deemed to be collecting or using data irresponsibly, or products they feel are misleading.

#### Sharing restricted content

Businesses can’t list products or services that contain adult or gambling-oriented content and prohibited products such as alcoholic beverages. Political and copyrighted content also falls under this policy.

Because of these restrictions, some business offerings wouldn’t be well suited for the Product Editor as failure to comply may risk [Google account suspension](https://www.vendasta.com/blog/google-account-suspension/).

### Prohibited items

[Items prohibited](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/6150006?sjid=9688425465176364588-NA) on Google Business Profile include:

### What businesses benefit most from adding products to Google Business Profile?

#### Retail stores

Brick-and-mortar stores with regular [business hours](https://www.vendasta.com/blog/google-business-hours/) can showcase their products on Google Business Profile to increase the visibility of their offerings and attract more potential customers. Take, for example, this screenshot from a bookstore that caters to university students. From the selection shown, you can see that the business sells much more than just books. This large selection could prove to be more appealing to a student looking for a one-stop shop for all their freshman needs.

## Tips for optimizing products for GBP and local SEO

Fine-tuning your client’s product listings can help increase relevancy and authority in local searches, which can attract more potential customers to their door. Here are some tips to help you get the most out of this feature for your SMB clients.

### Provide complete and accurate information

Make sure to provide complete and accurate information about your products, including product names, categories, prices, and descriptions. This will help customers find what they're looking for and make the best-informed decision for their needs.

### Use high-quality Images

Have you ever gone to a [restaurant](https://www.vendasta.com/blog/restaurant-seo/) and decided to purchase a dish based on the image alone? A picture is indeed worth a thousand words. Clean, professional images of products naturally catch the eye and influence people’s purchasing decisions. Make sure to use clear, well-lit photos on your GBP that accurately represent your client’s products. You can also use multiple images to show different angles and highlight features.


### Write effective product descriptions

Writing effective product descriptions can help you highlight their unique features and benefits, so make sure to use clear and concise language and focus on the key selling points of your products.

Here’s an example:

*"Experience our signature Bubble Tea, a delightful fusion of freshly brewed tea, creamy milk, and chewy tapioca pearls. Choose from classic black tea or exotic fruit infusions for a refreshing and satisfying sip. Available in small, medium, and large sizes."*

### Include relevant keywords

This is important because it helps the product better appear in search results related to that category of goods. Make sure to add [keywords on your Google Business Profile](https://www.vendasta.com/blog/add-keywords-google-business-profile/) that are not only commonly used by your target audience but also accurately describe your product.

### Regularly update and manage your product listings

Nothing lasts forever, including product lines. Regularly updating product listings ensures that users always know what your client has in stock, and are not left disappointed when they stop by in person.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

If you're having trouble adding products to your client’s Google Business Profile listing, you're not alone. Here are a few common problems you might face and how to troubleshoot them:

### Issue: No option to add products

If you don't see the option to add products to your client's listing, make sure to confirm with them that they have a [verified Google Business Profile](https://www.vendasta.com/blog/google-verify-my-business/) account. If they're not verified, you won't be able to add product information. Some hurdles you may face when performing verification include [deleting duplicate accounts](https://www.vendasta.com/blog/deleting-google-business-account/) or [merging multiple GBP listings](https://www.vendasta.com/blog/merge-google-business-listings/).

If they are verified, check that the business category is set to "Retail" or "Service," as these are the only categories that allow for product listings.

### Issue: Products not showing up

If you've added products to your listing, but they're not showing up, there are a few things you can try. First, make sure you've added the products correctly using the manual Product Editor or Pointy. Secondly, double-check that you've included all the necessary information, such as product name, description, and price.

If the product listing is still not showing up, don’t worry, as it may take some time for them to appear. Google needs to verify your products before they can be displayed, so be patient and check back in a few days.

### Issue: Products not approved

If your products are not approved, it may be because they violate Google's product policy or contain incomplete information. Fortunately, if your products have not been approved, you'll receive an email from Google explaining the reason why. This explanation should help you determine if the product can be listed or make the necessary changes to resubmit your products for approval.
