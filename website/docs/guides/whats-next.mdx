3. Provide your business name and its main category
Now, you need to give the business name and its primary business category. This step is one of the most important steps because it is the first thing users will see when they come to your business profile on Google.

Enter an exact business name - one by which users can search for your business.
Enter a category - you can choose it from those available. If you are a dentist, choose the dentist category. If you are a restaurant, choose the restaurant category and so on...
‍

4. Select if you want your customers to see your business address
Here you have to choose if you want customers to know the address of your business and be able to map a route to it. Consider whether your business type benefits from displaying a physical location. Choose whether you have a location customers can visit, such as a local store or office, or if you prefer to keep your address private. Think about whether or not you want customers to see a pin with your business address marked on it and be able to map a route to it.

Many companies choose - Yes

‍

Choose if you want to display the physical address of the company
4.1 If you selected "yes"
If you have chosen to add the company's address (physical location) to your business listing, you must complete the address details, including your mailing address.

You need to specify in them:

Country
address
city
postal code (if any)
enter the physical location of your business (e.g. local store or company’s office).

4.2 If you marked - "no" or "yes"

Here you need to enter the serive area where your business provides its services (if it does). For online retail or service businesses, Google recommends that these service areas should not be farther than a 2.5-hour drive from your company.  

Just enter the cities or zip codes. You can add several.

Sometimes you will be given one verification option. Sometimes you will be given many, from which you can choose one that is most convenient for you. Unfortunately, the forms of the verification of Google business profiles are entirely up to Google, and you can not impact it.

Remember that your business profile on Google will not be visible until you verify it.

Have you verified your profile? It will appear on Google soon!
If you have already gone through verifying your business profile on Google, be patient. It won't appear on Google right away. Sometimes it takes a few hours, sometimes a few days. You will undoubtedly receive an email from Google informing you that your business profile is now visible to customers in Google search and Google Maps.
